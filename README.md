# 🏋️‍♂️ Personalized AI Workout & Diet Planner

A web-based **AI-powered fitness recommendation system** that generates **personalized workout routines and diet plans** for students based on their **fitness goal, experience level, and available equipment**.  
The application is built using **Python and Streamlit** and deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Most fitness applications provide **generic workout and diet plans** that do not consider:
- Individual fitness levels (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
- Different goals (Muscle Gain, Weight Loss, Maintenance)
- Equipment availability (Gym / No Equipment)
- Student lifestyle constraints

This project addresses these issues by providing **personalized, practical, and data-driven fitness plans**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Generate personalized workout routines using AI-based logic  
- Adapt exercises based on fitness level and goal  
- Provide safe and scientifically valid recommendations  
- Embed verified YouTube workout videos  
- Deploy a cloud-based web application accessible anywhere  

---

## 🧠 Features

- Fitness level–based exercise selection  
- Goal-oriented workout plans  
- Equipment-aware filtering  
- YouTube exercise video integration  
- Interactive UI using Streamlit  
- Cloud deployment with public access
